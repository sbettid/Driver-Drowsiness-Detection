# Drivers Drowsiness Detection - ATML Project README

In this repository, you can find the following notebooks that have been used during the development of the project: 

- **Folder preparation**: this notebook was necessary to restructure the original dataset and thus it is not required to run it again, unless the original dataset is downloaded from scratch. 
- **Model definition**: this notebook was used to train the model, starting from the restructured dataset. This notebook can be run on Google Colab in order to re-train the model. 
- **Real time application**: this notebook can be run also locally, to load the model and apply it on the frames capture by a webcam.
